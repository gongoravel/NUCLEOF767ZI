# NUCLEOF767ZI
Some examples for using the peripherals of the NUCLEOF767ZI Board
This folder contains the main code of some projects developed in Keil uVision5 for the NUCLEOF767ZI board. Each subfolder corresponds to a different project where different peripherals of the STM32F767ZI MCU are being explored. These projects are being developed from scratch and I think it would be a good resource in order to explore firmware development through the configuration of the registers of the MCU. The code contained in this folder is better commented and more readable than my other repository dedicated to the STM32F4Discovery board. I hope it helps.

Finally, if you have any questions or comments do not hesitate to contact me, I will be happy to help. I am not an expert but I have some experience using the STM32 MCUs especially by developing the code configuring the registers from scratch.

Thank you for your attention and I hope my code helps. Happy hacking!
